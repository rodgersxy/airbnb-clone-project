### Importance of Identifying Design Properties in a Mockup  
Identifying the design properties of a mockup is essential because:   
1. **Consistency**: Ensures that colors, typography, and layouts remain uniform throughout the application.   
2. **Clarity**: Clearly defined properties guide developers and designers, reducing misinterpretation and maintaining visual harmony.  
3. **Efficiency**: Saves time during development by providing a reference for styling decisions.   
4. **Scalability**: Establishes a design system that can be reused and scaled for future features or updates.
